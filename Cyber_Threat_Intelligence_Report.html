<h1>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Report</h1>
<p><b>Date of Access:</b> 24 November 2025</p>
<p><b>Date of Information:</b> 24 November 2025</p>
<p><b>Reporting Period:</b> 17 November 2025 - 24 November 2025</p>
<p><b>Distribution:</b> Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> The intent of this report is to provide a high-level overview of significant cyberspace developments during the reporting period. The report consists of open-source reporting and updates on vulnerabilities and exploits, ransomware and malware, and cyberattacks and campaigns.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Executive Summary:</b> During the reporting period, notable trends in cyber threats and vulnerabilities were observed, particularly the escalation of supply chain attacks driven by the Sha1-Hulud malware, which compromised over 26,000 npm packages and underscored the need for urgent audits on affected software. A significant breach was reported at the technology supplier SitusAMC, exposing sensitive data from various major U.S. banks on 12 November, further heightening risks within the financial sector. Concurrently, Harvard University disclosed a vishing attack that compromised alumni and donor information, while several organizations, including DoorDash and Delta Dental, faced data breaches linked to social engineering tactics. There are indications of potential collaboration among advanced persistent threat groups, including connections to Chinese cyber actors, amplifying concerns regarding the security of supply chains and third-party services.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Vulnerabilities & Exploits:</b> During the reporting period, significant developments in cybersecurity and legal issues emerged, with the discovery of critical vulnerabilities in the open-source logging agent Fluent Bit, posing threats to cloud infrastructures and remote code execution. Concurrently, Harvard University reported a vishing attack that compromised personal data in its Alumni Affairs systems. In news from the sports world, Hall of Fame player Chauncey Billups faced serious legal challenges, pleading not guilty to charges associated with rigged poker games. Additional events of note include ongoing discussions among U.S. and Ukrainian officials regarding a refined peace plan, alongside continuous concerns highlighted by the European Central Bank about the potential risks posed by digital currencies to financial stability.</li>
<li><b>Ransomware & Malware:</b> During the reporting period, significant trends in cyber threats were observed, including a resurgence of supply chain attacks exemplified by the aggressive Sha1-Hulud malware, which has compromised over 25,000 npm packages and targeted prominent services like Zapier and ENS Domains. New ClickFix attack variants were reported, utilizing deceptive Windows update screens to facilitate the download of info-stealer malware. Additionally, a Russian-linked campaign was identified that leverages malicious Blender files to propagate the StealC V2 information stealer malware, targeting creative professionals. Data breaches were notable, with Harvard University disclosing a vishing attack affecting sensitive personal information and real estate finance service SitusAMC facing a data breach impacting major banks. Lastly, reports indicate that ransomware attacks peak during weekends and holidays, highlighting the evolving tactics of threat actors within the cybersecurity landscape.</li>
<li><b>Cyberattacks & Campaigns:</b> During the reporting period, significant cyber threats continued to escalate, particularly with the emergence of the Sha1-Hulud malware targeting npm supply chains and compromising over 26,000 public repositories, necessitating immediate audits for at least 800 affected packages. Notably, a reported security breach at the technology supplier SitusAMC exposed sensitive data from major U.S. banks, heightening vulnerabilities in financial institutions on 12 November. Meanwhile, Harvard University disclosed a data breach impacting alumni and donor information due to a voice phishing attack. Suspicion of a potentially coordinated effort across advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, including links to Chinese actors, has led to heightened scrutiny of supply chains and third-party services. In addition, several companies, including DoorDash and Delta Dental, confirmed data breaches via social engineering tactics, indicating a persistent trend of exploiting human vulnerabilities in cybersecurity defenses.</li>
