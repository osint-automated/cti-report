<h1>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Report</h1>
<p><b>Date of Access:</b> 11 November 2025</p>
<p><b>Date of Information:</b> 11 November 2025</p>
<p><b>Reporting Period:</b> 04 November 2025 - 11 November 2025</p>
<p><b>Distribution:</b> Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> The intent of this report is to provide a high-level overview of significant cyberspace developments during the reporting period. The report consists of open-source reporting and updates on vulnerabilities and exploits, ransomware and malware, and cyberattacks and campaigns.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Executive Summary:</b> During the reporting period, several significant cybersecurity incidents and trends were identified, highlighting an escalation of sophisticated cyber threats. Notably, a zero-day vulnerability related to image files was exploited for nearly a year by spyware named "LANDFALL," specifically targeting Samsung Galaxy devices. The Clop ransomware group further demonstrated its capabilities by successfully compromising vulnerabilities in Oracle software, affecting over 100 organizations, including notable institutions such as the Washington Post and Harvard University. Additionally, there was a concerning breach at the U.S. Congressional Budget Office, which exposed sensitive financial information. Reports also surfaced indicating that 65% of top AI firms had leaked sensitive data on GitHub, while spear phishing attacks, particularly against the hospitality sector, were on the rise, with threats linked to foreign entities raising national security concerns. Concurrently, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre recommended new strategies to mitigate exposure management risks. These findings underscore the evolving landscape of cyber threats, emphasizing the need for enhanced security protocols across diverse digital platforms.</p>

<li><b>Vulnerabilities & Exploits:</b> During the reporting period, several notable cybersecurity incidents and developments emerged, including the discovery of sophisticated spyware named "LANDFALL" targeting Samsung Galaxy devices via a zero-day vulnerability related to image files. Additionally, a critical pre-authentication flaw in Monsta FTP could allow complete server takeovers, urging users to update immediately. A report highlighted that 65% of top AI firms have leaked sensitive data on GitHub, posing significant risks to their assets. Meanwhile, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre recommended alternatives to its Web Check and Mail Check services amid increasing exposure management challenges. These trends underscore the continuing evolution of cyber threats and the necessity for robust security measures across various digital platforms.</li>
<li><b>Ransomware & Malware:</b> During the reporting period, sophisticated cyber threats continued to proliferate, with a zero-day vulnerability in Samsung Galaxy devices exploited for nearly a year by a newly identified spyware called LANDFALL, capable of extensive surveillance and data collection. Attackers linked to China leveraged advanced spear phishing tactics, utilizing platforms such as LinkedIn to bypass traditional email security measures, while further reports indicated a dramatic increase in phishing attempts specifically targeting the hospitality sector. A series of alarming incidents highlighted the escalation of cybercriminal activities, including the compromise of multiple organizations through campaigns linked to notorious ransomware groups like Cl0p and FIN11, as well as attacks on critical infrastructure leveraging IoT and outdated device vulnerabilities. Lastly, cybersecurity researchers uncovered malicious packages on NuGet aimed at future disruptions in database functionalities, reflecting a trend towards long-term attack strategies in the threat landscape.</li>
<li><b>Cyberattacks & Campaigns:</b> During the reporting period, significant cybersecurity challenges emerged as prominent entities grappled with high-profile attacks. The Clop ransomware gang reportedly exploited vulnerabilities in Oracle's business software, impacting over 100 organizations, including the Washington Post and Harvard University, while a breach at the U.S. Congressional Budget Office exposed sensitive financial data. Furthermore, the sophisticated "LANDFALL" spyware specifically targeted Samsung Galaxy phones, indicating a growing trend in mobile device exploitation. Simultaneously, foreign entities, allegedly linked to the Chinese Communist Party, raised concerns regarding land acquisitions near U.S. military installations. These events reflect a broader landscape of increasing adversarial cyber activities, whereby threat actors employ advanced tactics to infiltrate a range of sectors.</li>
