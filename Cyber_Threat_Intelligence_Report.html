<h1>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Report</h1>
<p><b>Date of Access:</b> 28 November 2025</p>
<p><b>Date of Information:</b> 28 November 2025</p>
<p><b>Reporting Period:</b> 21 November 2025 - 28 November 2025</p>
<p><b>Distribution:</b> Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> The intent of this report is to provide a high-level overview of significant cyberspace developments during the reporting period. The report consists of open-source reporting and updates on vulnerabilities and exploits, ransomware and malware, and cyberattacks and campaigns.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Executive Summary:</b> During the reporting period, the cybersecurity landscape revealed a significant rise in sophisticated attack methods and incidents targeting various sectors. A new Mirai-based malware variant known as 'ShadowV2' surfaced, focusing on IoT devices, while critical vulnerabilities were identified in platforms such as GitLab and the 'node-forge' JavaScript package. Notably, ransomware attacks disrupted operations for the Asahi Group and compromised emergency response systems via a coordinated cyberattack on the OnSolve CodeRED platform, impacting public safety. Additionally, hackers affiliated with the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters group employed novel phishing tactics, while the Bloody Wolf campaign exploited legitimate software against Central Asian government targets. Concerns regarding outdated technology in national infrastructure were raised, and significant advancements in security were announced by major firms, including Microsoft and ASUS, aiming to fortify defenses against unauthorized access. An increasing focus on exploiting software development environments was also highlighted by the Shai-Hulud supply chain attack, affecting over 830 npm packages.</p>

<li><b>Vulnerabilities & Exploits:</b> During the reporting period, notable advancements and ongoing challenges in the cybersecurity landscape were highlighted by an increase in sophisticated attack vectors. A new variant of Mirai-based malware, 'ShadowV2', emerged targeting IoT devices, while multiple vulnerabilities were exposed in applications like GitLab and the 'node-forge' JavaScript package, indicating a persistent threat environment. Additionally, security enhancements were announced by major technology firms, such as Microsoft’s upcoming measures to block unauthorized attacks on Entra ID and ASUS’s release of firmware updates addressing critical vulnerabilities. Furthermore, a report indicated that outdated technology within national infrastructure continues to pose significant risks, emphasizing the need for continuous modernization to thwart cyber threats.</li>
<li><b>Ransomware & Malware:</b> During the reporting period, notable cyber threats and incidents emerged, underscoring a trend towards increasingly sophisticated attacks. A ransomware strike on the Asahi Group potentially exposed data of nearly two million individuals, and the company is experiencing significant operational disruptions as a result. Simultaneously, hackers affiliated with the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters group have resurfaced, now utilizing new phishing domains to enhance their campaigns. A coordinated cyberattack on the OnSolve CodeRED platform compromised emergency alert systems across multiple U.S. regions, impacting vital public safety operations. Additionally, advanced threats like the Shai-Hulud supply chain attack have targeted the npm ecosystem, compromising over 830 packages, while newly identified malware families such as ShadowV2 and RomCom demonstrate evolving tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in cloud services and enterprise systems.</li>
<li><b>Cyberattacks & Campaigns:</b> During the reporting period, multiple cyber incidents underscored the rising threat landscape for organizations and government entities. Hackers executed a campaign hijacking US radio equipment to transmit false emergency alerts, prompting advisories from the FCC. Concurrently, the Bloody Wolf campaign demonstrated the exploitation of legitimate remote-administration software against Central Asian government targets. OpenAI informed API users that a breach at its analytics provider, Mixpanel, might have compromised limited personal data, further spotlighting vulnerabilities within the tech sector. Additionally, ransomware incidents disrupted operations across various entities, including a significant attack on the OnSolve CodeRED notification system affecting US emergency services and a prolonged incident impacting Japanese beer giant Asahi's operations. This period also saw the emergence of a sophisticated npm supply chain attack, indicating an increased focus on exploiting software development environments.</li>
