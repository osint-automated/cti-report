<h1>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Report</h1>
<p><b>Date of Access:</b> 12 December 2025</p>
<p><b>Date of Information:</b> 12 December 2025</p>
<p><b>Reporting Period:</b> 05 December 2025 - 12 December 2025</p>
<p><b>Distribution:</b> Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> The intent of this report is to provide a high-level overview of significant cyberspace developments during the reporting period. The report consists of open-source reporting and updates on vulnerabilities and exploits, ransomware and malware, and cyberattacks and campaigns.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Executive Summary:</b> During the reporting period, a range of critical cybersecurity incidents and trends emerged, underscoring persistent vulnerabilities across various sectors. A sophisticated text scam aimed at Freedom Mobile customers highlighted ongoing consumer threats, while the discovery of the NANOREMOTE malware utilized by the Google Drive API for command-and-control operations presented new challenges in malware detection and management. The cyber incident involving Conduent Business Solutions, revealing unauthorized access beginning on 21 October 2024, illustrated the long-lasting nature of advanced persistent threats. Vulnerabilities in industrial control systems attracted attention, particularly risks associated with cross-site scripting and remote exploitation, amidst reports of advanced malware deployments like CastleLoader targeting governmental entities via innovative espionage techniques. Furthermore, high-profile data breaches, notably at Petco, compromised customer personal data and emphasized the necessity for increased vigilance in cybersecurity across all sectors.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Vulnerabilities & Exploits:</b> During the reporting period, significant trends emerged highlighting the intersection of technology, security, and legal issues across multiple sectors. The energy sector is increasingly transitioning towards renewable sources, driving demand for cloud security as digitalization plays a pivotal role, particularly in Europe. In the legal arena, OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit related to interactions with ChatGPT, emphasizing the potential implications of AI technologies. Additionally, a major cybersecurity alert was issued regarding a high-severity unpatched vulnerability in the Gogs Git service, which has resulted in active exploitation of numerous servers. Meanwhile, tech giants are increasingly crowdfunding AI development initiatives, with significant investments noted in firms such as Port IO Ltd. and Harness Inc., as they seek to innovate within software lifecycles and application delivery.</li>
<li><b>Ransomware & Malware:</b> During the reporting period, significant developments in cyber threats were observed, particularly concerning the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities and the proliferation of sophisticated malware campaigns. Attackers actively exploited a critical vulnerability in Gogs, allowing remote code execution on numerous servers, while a new wave of phishing and malware delivery methods escalated, utilizing platforms like Visual Studio Code and even trusted software updates to distribute threats. AI-driven attacks gained traction, enhancing the ability of cybercriminals to automate processes such as reconnaissance and malware generation, further complicating detection efforts. Noteworthy also was the emergence of targeted campaigns, including efforts tied to geopolitical tensions, illustrating an increased focus on critical infrastructure and sensitive governmental entities. Additionally, a report highlighted that a significant percentage of small businesses faced data breaches, underscoring the urgent need for improved cybersecurity measures across sectors.</li>
<li><b>Cyberattacks & Campaigns:</b> During the reporting period, multiple significant cybersecurity incidents and trends emerged, highlighting ongoing vulnerabilities and threats across various sectors. A text scam targeting Freedom Mobile customers warned of a fake billing issue, while researchers disclosed a sophisticated new Windows backdoor malware named NANOREMOTE that leverages the Google Drive API for command-and-control operations. Furthermore, the Conduent Business Solutions cyber incident revealed unauthorized access that began as early as 21 October 2024, reflecting the long-term implications of advanced persistent threats. Notably, vulnerabilities in multiple industrial control systems were reported, with cross-site scripting and remote exploitation risks receiving particular attention. Hackers were also reported deploying advanced malware like CastleLoader and attacking government entities using new espionage techniques. Finally, high-profile data breaches, including a significant one at Petco affecting customer personal data, underscore the need for heightened vigilance across the digital landscape.</li>
