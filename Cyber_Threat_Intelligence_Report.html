<h1>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Report</h1>
<p><b>Date of Access:</b> 01 December 2025</p>
<p><b>Date of Information:</b> 01 December 2025</p>
<p><b>Reporting Period:</b> 24 November 2025 - 01 December 2025</p>
<p><b>Distribution:</b> Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> The intent of this report is to provide a high-level overview of significant cyberspace developments during the reporting period. The report consists of open-source reporting and updates on vulnerabilities and exploits, ransomware and malware, and cyberattacks and campaigns.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Executive Summary:</b> During the reporting period, key developments in cybersecurity reflect an intensifying landscape of threats and innovations. A notable rise in cyber incidents was observed, including the emergence of a ClickFix malware variant that impersonated a Windows update to gain administrative access, underscoring evolving social engineering techniques. Activities by North Korea-linked actors escalated with the deployment of OtterCookie malware via 197 malicious npm packages, and a ransomware attack on Japan's Asahi Group potentially compromised the data of nearly 2 million individuals. In the United States, the Chinese cyberespionage group Salt Typhoon has reportedly breached telecommunications networks, impacting nearly all citizens. Concurrently, South Korea's Coupang disclosed unauthorized access affecting 33.7 million users, while the cryptocurrency platform Upbit faced a hack resulting in a loss of approximately $36.9 million. Additionally, a new campaign attributed to the actor Bloody Wolf showcased a shift in tactics by exploiting legitimate software to target governmental entities in Central Asia. The overall cyber threat landscape indicates increasing harm to organizational and individual data security, punctuated by coordinated cyberattacks causing disruption in local government services.</p>

<li><b>Vulnerabilities & Exploits:</b> During the reporting period, notable developments include escalating tensions surrounding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, illustrated by Russia's drone strikes on Kyiv causing casualties and power outages; this highlights the continuing volatility in the region. In cybersecurity, a significant vulnerability was reported in Airbus's flight-control software, prompting concerns over aircraft safety, with potential impacts on over 6,000 planes. Additionally, the alarming rise in arrests linked to the "764" online exploitation network underscores the growing concern over child safety and digital threats. The Democratic Party in the U.S. faces increased internal divisions, with lawmakers urging military personnel to resist orders, reflecting a deepening political rift. Finally, trends of right-wing political movements gaining traction in Europe are attributed to the fallout from the Ukrainian crisis and migration pressures, prompting discussions among political analysts on the implications for stability in the region.</li>
<li><b>Ransomware & Malware:</b> During the reporting period, cybersecurity incidents showcased a significant rise in threats and innovative tactics employed by threat actors. A newly identified ClickFix malware variant impersonated a critical Windows update to gain administrative access, highlighting the continuous evolution of social engineering techniques. Additionally, North Korea-linked groups have intensified their activities, launching new OtterCookie malware through 197 malicious npm packages, while a ransomware attack on Japan's Asahi Group potentially compromised data for nearly 2 million individuals. Furthermore, the emergence of AI-driven autonomous cyberattacks and vulnerabilities within both legacy and contemporary software systems emphasizes the growing complexity and scale of cyber threats today.</li>
<li><b>Cyberattacks & Campaigns:</b> During the reporting period, significant cyber incidents highlighted vulnerabilities across various sectors. Notably, former FBI officials indicated that the Chinese cyberespionage group Salt Typhoon has likely impacted every American through a breach of US telecommunications networks. In South Korea, Coupang reported unauthorized access exposing personal information of 33.7 million users, while Upbit faced scrutiny after approximately $36.9 million was hacked from its platform. Furthermore, a new campaign attributed to the actor Bloody Wolf exploited legitimate software to target government entities in Central Asia, illustrating an evolution in tactics. The cyber landscape continues to reflect increasing threats, with notable disruptions to local government services in London also reported due to coordinated cyberattacks, alongside challenges observed in third-party vendor security seen in breaches involving OpenAI's analytics partner, Mixpanel.</li>
