<h1>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Report</h1>
<p><b>Date of Access:</b> 10 November 2025</p>
<p><b>Date of Information:</b> 10 November 2025</p>
<p><b>Reporting Period:</b> 07 November 2025 - 10 November 2025</p>
<p><b>Distribution:</b> Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.</p>
<p><b>Intent:</b> The intent of this report is to provide a high-level overview of significant cyberspace developments during the reporting period. The report consists of open-source reporting and updates on vulnerabilities and exploits, ransomware and malware, and cyberattacks and campaigns.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Executive Summary:</b> During the reporting period, significant cybersecurity developments were observed, including the identification of AI-enhanced malware by researchers at Google, revealing a new dimension in cyber threats. A zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21042) was exploited by spyware known as LANDFALL on Samsung Galaxy devices, emphasizing the ongoing risk within mobile technology. Additionally, a breach at the U.S. Congressional Budget Office attributed to suspected foreign actors exposed sensitive financial information, paralleling an incident involving a China-linked group that maintained prolonged access to a U.S. non-profit for espionage. The proliferation of ransomware, particularly the targeting of The Washington Post by the Clop gang via Oracle vulnerabilities, and the discovery of malicious packages capable of sabotage on NuGet platforms further underscored escalating risks within both public and private sectors.</p>

<li><b>Vulnerabilities & Exploits:</b> During the reporting period, researchers at Google identified malware capable of leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance its execution, addressing a significant advancement in cyber threats. Additionally, a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21042) in Samsung Galaxy devices was exploited by previously unknown spyware, LANDFALL, to conduct surveillance over nearly a year, drawing attention to ongoing vulnerabilities in widely used mobile technology. The Congressional Budget Office suffered a security breach linked to suspected foreign actors, exposing sensitive financial research. Further impacting security landscapes, the Dutch government's intervention with chipmaker Nexperia has disrupted global auto production due to national security concerns, underlining the geopolitical tensions in the semiconductor supply chain. Overall, these incidents highlight increasing risks and vulnerabilities across technological and governmental platforms.</li>
<li><b>Ransomware & Malware:</b> During the reporting period, researchers at Google identified a growing trend of malware utilizing artificial intelligence capabilities to enhance its execution, highlighting an evolution in cyber threats. Additionally, a China-linked group successfully breached a U.S. non-profit organization to maintain prolonged access for espionage purposes, reflecting ongoing geopolitical tensions in cyberspace. An alarming campaign involving malicious packages on NuGet was uncovered, capable of executing time-delayed sabotage attacks on industrial control systems. Incidents of ransomware also proliferated, with the Clop gang targeting The Washington Post through Oracle vulnerabilities. Furthermore, a new Android spyware called LANDFALL was exploited via a zero-day vulnerability in Samsung devices, underlining the persistent vulnerability landscape.</li>
<li><b>Cyberattacks & Campaigns:</b> During the reporting period, significant cybersecurity incidents included a former Intel software engineer accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents following his layoff, and a breach at the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) attributed to a suspected foreign hacker, raising concerns over exposed sensitive data. Meanwhile, a China-linked group gained prolonged access to a U.S. non-profit focused on policy matters, part of a broader campaign targeting U.S. entities. Additionally, vulnerabilities in Oracle software allowed the Clop ransomware gang to compromise the Washington Post, while security researchers disclosed critical zero-day flaws in QNAP NAS systems, further highlighting the ongoing security challenges faced by organizations.</li>
