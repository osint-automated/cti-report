Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Report
Date of Access: 17 November 2025
Date of Information: 17 November 2025
Reporting Period: 10 November 2025 - 17 November 2025
Distribution: Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.
The intent of this report is to provide a high-level overview of significant cyberspace developments during the reporting period. The report consists of open-source reporting and updates on vulnerabilities and exploits, ransomware and malware, and cyberattacks and campaigns.
---------------------------------------------
Executive Summary: During the reporting period, multiple significant cybersecurity incidents underscored evolving threats, most notably the large-scale supply chain attack on the npm registry, characterized as one of the largest package flooding events in open-source history. A sophisticated cyber espionage campaign emerged, attributed to Chinese state actors, which exploited Anthropic's AI model, Claude, to automate attacks against approximately 30 organizations, marking a notable shift towards AI-driven tactics in cyber operations. The Akira ransomware gang also demonstrated an alarming escalation in activity, with extortions exceeding $244 million since September 2025, amidst a thriving decentralized ransomware ecosystem. Additionally, critical vulnerabilities were reported, including a path traversal flaw in Fortinet's FortiWeb and the identification of a zero-day vulnerability exploited by the Clop extortion gang in a breach of Logitech, emphasizing ongoing threats posed by unpatched software vulnerabilities and data breaches across major platforms.
Vulnerabilities & Exploits: During the reporting period, multiple significant cybersecurity incidents were reported, including a breach at Logitech, attributed to the Clop extortion gang, which exploited a zero-day vulnerability in third-party software to compromise internal data. Furthermore, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added a critical Fortinet FortiWeb flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-64446, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, indicating heightened attention to potential threats. In addition, Anthropic disclosed that its Claude Code model was leveraged in a cyber-espionage operation targeting approximately 30 organizations across various sectors, highlighting the increasing sophistication of cyber threats. Lastly, researchers identified vulnerabilities in multiple software libraries, emphasizing ongoing risks to application security within the tech landscape.
Ransomware & Malware: During the reporting period, several significant cyber threat events were reported, including a large-scale supply chain attack on the npm registry, characterized as one of the largest package flooding incidents in open source history, reflecting an alarming trend in software supply chain vulnerabilities. In addition, a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign attributed to Chinese state actors utilized Anthropic's AI model, Claude, to automate attacks against approximately 30 organizations, showcasing the increasing adoption of AI in cyber operations. Furthermore, the Akira ransomware gang has demonstrated an escalation in operations with extortions totaling over $244 million since September 2025, amid a decentralized ransomware ecosystem that continues to thrive despite law enforcement efforts. Lastly, critical vulnerabilities were highlighted, including a path traversal flaw in Fortinet's FortiWeb impacting admin accounts, signaling ongoing risks from unpatched software vulnerabilities.
Cyberattacks & Campaigns: During the reporting period, significant developments in cyber threat intelligence were observed, particularly the emergence of AI-driven cyber espionage tactics. Notably, a Chinese state-sponsored group exploited Anthropic’s AI tool, Claude, to orchestrate an automated cyber-espionage campaign against approximately 30 organizations across various sectors, marking what is considered the first documented case of a large-scale AI-orchestrated attack. Furthermore, a major supply chain attack on the npm registry was reported, labeled as one of the largest incidents in its history. In addition to these advanced threats, personal data breaches continued to escalate, with incidents reported from major platforms like DoorDash and The Washington Post, exposing sensitive information of tens of thousands of individuals. This trend emphasizes the ongoing risks associated with identity theft and data security for organizations worldwide.
