# Cyber Threat Intelligence Report Generator

This repository contains the Python script and related files for generating a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Report.

## Intent and Goal of the Report

The primary intent of this report (available as a web application here: https://cti-report.streamlit.app/) is to provide a high-level, concise overview of significant cyberspace developments and emerging threats during a specified reporting period.

**Key Goals:**

*   **Inform:** To keep stakeholders informed about the latest trends, vulnerabilities, and incidents in the cyber landscape.
*   **Summarize:** To consolidate information from various open-source intelligence (OSINT) reporting, making it accessible and easy to digest.
*   **Highlight Critical Areas:** To focus on crucial aspects such as:
    *   Vulnerabilities and Exploits
    *   Ransomware and Malware campaigns
    *   Major Cyberattacks and ongoing campaigns
*   **Provide Insights:** To offer actionable insights derived from the collected intelligence, aiding in proactive defense strategies.

The report is generated using a Python script (`app.py`) which processes open-source intelligence to compile these updates. The web application, built with Streamlit, provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to view the generated reports.
